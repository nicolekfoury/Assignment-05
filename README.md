# Personas
#### Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX Storytelling helps the designers truly empathasize and put themselves in the shoes of the user like no other. When one has to develop a persona that would use their product, the intuitions, behaviors, thoughts, and experiences of this supposed individual help the designers curate a product that is aimed for its users and considerate of their individual characteristics moreso than if no persona was created. For my project in particular, I realized that the information presented to my users can be optimized, so that articles users click on after choosing one of the topics of the main menu will have a "favorite" option which will bookmark their articles at the top of the screen, so that users can keep track of all of the information that they consume in an interactive, easy way. In addition, adding an "advanced search" bar once a user clicks on one of the main menu titles, can help them specify an article that would answer the specific health question they have in mind in optimal time.
